## Team Members

## Description
The current target for this game is to make it so that we can have two players (baby yodas) shooting at each other in competition. We will have different weapons to pick up and a system to keep the score counter for each player. There will be an interactive environment and obstacles to avoid or use as a hiding space. 

## Current Functionality
The player is currently able to walk around, look, jump, run, and crouch.
Half of a door is functioning, where it can open by walking into a collider.
